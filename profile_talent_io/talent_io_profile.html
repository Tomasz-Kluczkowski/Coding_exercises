<strong>A bit about me</strong>
I am a Junior Python/Django developer @ TutorCruncher. I am involved in all aspects of the project from back
end to front end. The stack is Python/Django/Javascript. I am involved in API building, backend logic, UI
aspects, unit testing, optimizing database access etc. I really love learning new technologies and am looking
for a position where mentorship is provided and the new developer has a chance to practice new frameworks.
I am actively participating in open source projects trough Python Sprints meetup group where I am one of the
co-organizers.

<strong>When I chill...</strong>
In my free time I snipe as Nova or freeze others as Jaina in Heroes of the Storm or shoot my friends in pvp Wildlands :).
I wouldn't mind a bout or two in Street Fighter 5 as well :).
To keep life balanced I try to run and weight lift.
