# Coding_exercises
Short coding exercises too keep algorithmic thinking going.

Starting with Codewars and expanding to use other websites and challenge myself in continous learning here.

Each exercise will have its own folder in which there will be source and tests.

Things to train here:

- Test Driven Development.
  Each exercise will have its test suite in pytest so that it becomes second nature to use in the future.
  Solving a problem will start from writing basic tests.

- Knowledge of algorithms and data structures to apply to efficient problem solving later on.
